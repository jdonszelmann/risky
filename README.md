# Risky

Risky is a very simple toy kernel written almost complety in Rust, targeted for the SiFive Unleashed. This means the 
compilation target is the RiscV 64 bit ISA. As there is very little documentation available on how to make practically 
anything for RiscV cpus, this will be a very wild ride.
